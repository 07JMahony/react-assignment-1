## Routing.

[ List the __new routes__ supported by your app and state the associated page.]

## Independent learning (If relevant).

Itemize the technologies/techniques you researched independently and adopted in your project, 
i.e. aspects not covered in the lectures/labs. Include the source code filenames that illustrate these 
(we do not require code excerpts) and provide references to the online resources that helped you (articles/blogs).
